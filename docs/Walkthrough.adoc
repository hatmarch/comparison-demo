= Comparison Walkthrough =

Premise: You have a (petclinic) spring application that you need to  host in the cloud.  Letâ€™s look at how different facets of this are done in AWS and then in OpenShift

== Local creation ==

Show our demo running locally 
For ease, this will be running in two containers on my local laptop
POTENTIALLY: Loop around to show CRC running on local laptop?

== Development Environment Creation ==

How to get our application deployed to Dev

=== AWS ===
Show how ElasticBeanstalk provisions multiple VM with RDS

Show LoadBalancers and reference Route53


=== OpenShift ===
Show MySQL operator and then CR for provisioning of database
Show Template for creating a tomcat app
S2I

How Services and replicasets are an analog to Load Balancers and ASG

NOTE: AZ vs. Nodes

== Continuous Integration ==

Show that checking into a git repo can trigger integration chain and deployment to dev

=== AWS ===
Show CodeDeploy with EB

=== Openshift ===
Show Tekton (OpenShift Pipeline) or Jenkins with Openshift

== Production Environments ==

Show how we create additional environments and update pipeline to be able to deploy into these

=== AWS ===
 Show creation of staging and production environment in EB

=== OpenShift ===

Show creation of staging and production projects in OS

Deploy the latest

Deploy a rollback

[NOTE]
====
But first need to make sure image stream is tagged appropriately in the CICD project where is the sha for an image in the local test-petclinic4 image registry for app jws-app

== Monitoring Application ==
